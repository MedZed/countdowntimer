 DailyUI #014 - Countdown timer. For this one I was thinking a bit about how a simple countdown timer could work on a smart watch, hence the circle shape and touch controls.

Tap to stop/reset/start.
When stopped, slide to set the time (it's a little hard to get it to an exact value).

Looks best on touch devices!

Using css blend modes to achieve the text effect and viewport units to scale things nicely (so useful!).
